Special features
================

Put additional flags in or remove flags you don't like from the
../Textures/Flags directory if your favourite flag isn't included
or you're not happy with the provided set of flags. The demo
loads all image files in that directory in .png, .tga, .bmp, .dds,
.pcx or .jpg format.



Controls
========

F1 opens the settings menu. Settings can then changed and
will be stored and used in all my demos.

Refer to my site for information and ways to contact me if there is a problem.
I appreciate bug-reports and feedback.



Compiling code
==============

To compile this code, a framework available on my site is needed,
as well as libraries also available at my site. If there's a
problem with compiling the code, make sure that you got the right
framework, and that you have a recent enough copy of it. If it
still won't compile, refer to my site for ways to contact me.
Also, note that older frameworks may not compile on other compilers
that MSVC 6.0 and gcc.
