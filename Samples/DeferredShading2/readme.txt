Controls
========

F1 opens the settings dialog. Settings can then be changed
and will be stored. All demos based on Framework3 share
the same settings. Additional tabs are sometimes available
in the settings dialog for demo specific settings.

Demo specific controls:
-----------------------
F5 - Default mode (2 passes, one for edge pixels and one for interior pixels)
F6 - Edge shader (multiple samples) on entire screen
F7 - Interior shader (single sample) on entire screen
F8 - Stencil mask visualization
These options are also available on the F1 dialog.

Troubleshooting
===============

Is there a problem running the demo?
Refer to my site for information and ways to contact me if there is a problem.
I appreciate bug-reports and feedback.

If you're experiencing a "side-by-side configuration" problem, installing the MSVC++
runtime redist should fix it:

If you're getting an error about a missing d3dx dll file, try installing the latest runtime components:

Compiling code
==============

To compile this code, you need Framework3.zip from my site.
If there's a problem with compiling the code, make sure that you
got the right 
framework, and that you have a recent enough copy of it.
If it still won't compile, refer to my site for ways to contact me.
