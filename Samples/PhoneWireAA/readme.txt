and will be stored. All demos based on Framework3 share
the same settings. Additional tabs are sometimes available
in the settings dialog for demo specific settings.

Troubleshooting
===============

Is there a problem running the demo?
Refer to my site for information and ways to contact me if there is a problem.
I appreciate bug-reports and feedback.

If you're experiencing a "side-by-side configuration" problem, installing the MSVC++
runtime redist should fix it:

If you're getting an error about a missing d3dx dll file, try installing the latest runtime components:

Compiling code
==============

To compile this code, you need Framework3.zip from my site.
If there's a problem with compiling the code, make sure that you
got the right 
framework, and that you have a recent enough copy of it.
If it still won't compile, refer to my site for ways to contact me.
